# Task Manager Project

### Description
This is program that lets you manage tasks based on: assigned user, date assigned and due date.
Hopefully it will help when managing large projects with multiple users who have a variety of tasks assigned to them!


### Installation
Download the file task_manager.py (contains the main program). You can run this using VS Code.
There are two extra files called tasks.txt and user.txt. They contain example tasks and users, which you can replace.
The code will also run fine without those installed, as it will create new ones when it runs.

### Usage
Using this program you can:
  - Register a new user
  - Add a new task (which will include assigned user, task title and description, date assigned, and date due)
  - View all tasks that have been saved using the program
  - View all the tasks belonging to the user currently logged in
  - Generate reports about the tasks have been generated and tracked using the program
  - Display statistics from these reports
